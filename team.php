                    <p>We are team Amigos. A team that consists of three people that are highly enthusiastic about coding. We are currently studying Software Development in college and create websites, unity games and others things like C# ASCII games. We are currently coding in several languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, JS and C#.</p>
                    <p>One of our most recent projects is making an ASCII game in C#. This involves turning a console application into an adventure game.</p>
